All Your Data Are Belong To Us - Our team project for the 2015 Teradata UCSD hackathon

This repository contains the code that we created for the Teradata UCSD Hackathon.

We had a team of five students, representing the UCSD Data Science Student Society:
Joshua Wheeler, Nathan Moreno, Camille Schlesinger, Cameron Ellis, Chad Atalla

The code was developed over the course of 8 hours, and our team took first place.

The project includes a few tools with different purposes:
- Simplify the query and save process through the Teradata REST API (for Teradata SQL databases)
- Feature learning tool: provide rapid feature analysis of a database, identify features with strong positive correlation

We will be making an effort to revisit the code and provide better documentation over the coming weeks (becuase documentation was not a priority during the hackathon).
